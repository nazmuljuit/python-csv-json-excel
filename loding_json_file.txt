Exercise: Loading JSON Files
In  the previous lecture, you learned that you can load a CSV file with this code:

import pandas
df1 = pandas.read_csv("supermarkets.csv")
Try loading the supermarkets.json file for this exercise using read_json instead of read_csv.

The supermarkets.json file can be found inside the supermarkets.zip file attached in the previous lecture.
